# Renpy VN Template
A basic Renpy template for easy modification. 
I made this project for an easy renpy experience, this base has 6 prepared chapters, 4 prepared characters and is ready for images sound and story so feel free to let your creative side loose.
I hope to update this as I improve the base for a fun and easy time making visual novels.

Note: The start button currently does not funtion in this template. I hope to make it work at some point in the future.

# Using this template

## Downloading and preparing

- Download by clicking Code and then Download ZIP.
- Extract the files and then replace the files in a project. Dont replace or delete the `options.rpy` and `options.rpyc` files
- Change the name from `Renpy-VN-Template` to whatever you want to call the project.

### Editing The Visual Novel

Creating or editing Characters:
- Open `characters.rpy`.
- Define or create a new character. This should look like `define [Character] = Character("[Characters Name]")`, `[Character]` is a prefix to use when scripting the chapters and `[Characters Name]` will be the name displayed in game.

Creating or editing Chapters:
- Open `[Project Name]\game\chapters`.
- Select a chapter to open in your editing software or create a new one.
- Edit the chapter to fit your story in. For more details please refer to official renpy documentation.

## Roadmap
